Why did we decide to explore the four day work week?

It’s such a popular topic at the moment. We have seen various news article populating the media at a steady frequency over the course of the time we have been creating this project. It has been exciting to explore all of the ways different employers have attacked the work week in the aftermath of the pandemic. While we only found one company in New York City that is operating on a four day work week model, it has been interesting to see how the lack of companies operating on a four day work week in New York City, compares with the rest of the world.

The inspiration for our project has been largely shaped by popular culture including tweets, instagram posts, and online forums where users have been debating the pros and cons the four day work week. We wanted to collate these opinions and back it up with research and a case study into whether the four day work week has been successful for companies who have adopted it. We also wanted to explore the history for four day work week. Often a concept associated with Gen Z, we wanted to show how altercations to the work week have been in the works for a while. 

After reading “Do Not Track - Turning Pulp into Prototype with Agile Documentary” from Mapping the Intersection of Two Cultures: Interactive Documentary and Digital Journalism, we were fascinated by the section about storyboarding for interactive documentary, and inspired for our own project.

“The author’s responsibility is to present a cohesive and complete vision to the audience, whereas in the technology world the product is boss…It doesn’t matter what the author thinks if users don’t find value…that’s why there is such an emphasis on user-centric design.” (Uricchio et al., 93) 

The evaluation of the Do Not Track project gave us some food for thought about how we should be using interactivity. This distinction recognized by Uricchio highlighted the difference between online journalism and interactive journalism. We wanted users of our website to gain insight into the entire debate around the four day work week, a “cohesive and complete vision” about the pros and cons of the four day work week, its history, while offering a real life example. We decided the goal of our project would be to present a well-rounded exploration into the four day work week. We started by asking ourselves what would we want to learn about the four day work week and how it could help us in our employment? These initial musings and the Uricchio helped us finalize our interactive elements and how could use them to center the user in our project. 

Where did it all begin? 
We started by researching companies in New York City who would talk to us about the four day work week. The only company we discovered who is operating on a four day work week and talking about it publicly is Public Policy Lab. They agreed to talk to us and the project developed from there.

We knew we wanted to talk about the history of the four work week to dispel some of the negative connotations associated with the concept (i.e. gen z doesn’t want to work as much, they’re lazy, they’re entitled). Therefore, we knew one of our interactive elements would pertain to the history. We were really fascinated by Knight Lab’s timeline so decided to use this element for a visual exploration through the history of the four day work week.

Then, as one of the only companies operating on this schedule, we wanted to spotlight Public Policy Lab. We decided one of our elements would be centered about their experience of implementing the four day work week. We interviewed the sponsor of this schedule, Shanti Matthew, who broke down the whole implementation process for us. We knew this would be important to highlight, therefore, we decided one of our elements would be solely centered around Public Policy Lab. We all found Twine a really resourceful tool and decided we would do an interactive experience where users could click through various passages to learn more about the process, using selected videos from our interview.

Moreover, as our project was rooted in noticing online communities talking about this topic in popular culture, we wanted to collate some of these resources. We all really wanted to use StoryMap because we loved the interactive and visual elements that created a really immersive experience for the user. Therefore, we decided we would use Twxplorer to scan twitter, as well as our own scouring of the internet, to screenshot and collate news packages, tweets, instagram posts, and any other media forms we could find.

In addition, we chose to interview a labor historian about the history of the four day work week. We chose to interview Erik Loomis, a professor and labor historian at the University of Rhode Island, to understand how unions, the pandemic, and technology have intersectionally impacted American labor. Moreover, we asked Erik to walk us through labor legislation that’s changed the American relationship with labor, while also asking questions about the implementation of a four-day work week. Erik spoke to us via Zoom to break down the viability and history of a four day work week, specifically considering the question through lenses of race and class.


Knightlab’s timeline was the first element we created and presented to the class as our initial project. We sourced information from the internet about the history of the work week. We decided to start from the date the first work union was established, as this is when the work week first became subject to criticism. 

For the class presentation, we provided 20 dates from 1866 until 2022. We used archival images and YouTube sourced from Internet Archive and the web to make the timeline interactive and visually appealing.

Constructive criticism received:

When we presented this element to the class we got some good feedback that helped us develop this timeline even further. While several of our classmates liked our content, they wanted the multimedia elements to be more engaging. Therefore, we decided to implement some gifs and sources of popular culture to make the timeline more dynamic. 

In terms of the content, we had provided an overview of how the four day work week came to be by increasing criticism of the 40 hour work week. However, our professor suggested we cite some of the backlash that these union developments and rallies received to. This ensured that our timeline highlighted some of the struggles and is an indicator of potentially why the four day work week hasn’t been implemented at a faster pace in New York City and nationally.

TWINE:

We decided to use twine as a way to make the interview with Shanti Matthews from Public Policy Lab more interactive. We decided to divide the interview up into bitesize segments that answered questions that we believed users might have about the four day work week. 

We wanted to use multimedia elements including videos, photos, YouTube links, and gifs to make the experience more immersive. We also considered the user in the tone of our text as well. We asked lots of direct questions to establish a connection with the user. We also penned the twine code in a way that users would be able to have some autonomy through the code. We wanted them to be able to pick their own path. In turn, this makes the Twine different and unique for each user.

STORY MAP:


For our second element, we decided to create a story map that documents the public opinions on the implementation of a 4-day work week. We also made sure to include any necessary and informative articles, surveys, or reports from various outlets, organizations, or agencies. To gather all of this information, we used Knightlab’s twXplorer to review and collect tweets and data.

    Using twXplorer, we searched “4-day work week” which generated results in Tweets, Terms, Hashtags, and Links. After choosing the Tweets we want to use, we are able to copy and paste the Tweet’s link into the media section in the Story Map element. We then can include the location of that person or organization, which results in all the Tweets being populated onto the Story Map. To keep it more engaging, we also incorporated videos from YouTube that speak on the 4-day work week. As you click through the locations on the map, you can read the Tweets and also watch videos.

    We chose to have the majority of the Tweets to be located in New York City being that the project is New York City focused. However, we also decided to venture out of NYC as this is an issue present in public discourse on a national and international scale. Most of the Tweets express the need for the 4-day work week as trials have proven to bolster productivity and lessen stress and anxiety. 
 
Expert Q&A

We interviewed Erik Loomis, a professor and labor historian at the University of Rhode Island, over Zoom. After cutting up the interview using ProTools editing software, we imported the audio into Soundcloud and created a 10-track playlist of all of the responses to our questions.

Here are the questions we asked Erik:

For people who live and work in the United States, what does our current work week look like?

If people are working longer and harder hours than ever before, why do we still fixate on the idea of working 40 hours and five days a week?

You’re talking about the Fair Labor Standards Act, but that didn’t just come out of the work done by policymakers, did it?

In a lot of ways, technology has been touted as a tool to make us more productive at work. But is that how it’s actually played out for workforces in the U.S.?

Let’s talk about COVID-19…how did the pandemic shift how Americans think about their workweeks?

Ok, so what would the four-day work week actually look like?

What’s the argument to be made in support of the four-day work week?

Can you talk to me a little bit about the current state of unions in the United States?

If a four day work week is implemented, that wouldn’t necessarily solve the problem of workers being burnt out and being subjected to wage theft. So what can workers do to take back control over their own labor?

In order to display our audio interview with Erik Loomis on our webpage, we chose to embed Soundcloud audio links into the webpage since we initially had issues updating the code using Knightlab’s Soundcite audio hosting platform. We decided to cut up the interview to be “question and answer” style, meaning we could provide the user with written out questions. From there, users can click on embedded Soundcloud audio clips to get the “answers” to these questions. We believe that written questions and verbal answers would provide users with a more immerse experience that appeals to both visual and auditory learners. As users scroll through the immersive tool, they can dive deeper into the history of American labor and the broader implications of reimagining our work week.


WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED?

Through these past 15 weeks, our three group member have realized that creating a website – and learning three different coding languages – is difficult. But through persistence and hours of time spent learning the ins and outs of Javascript and HTML, we created a polished finished product. One of our biggest takeaways from this project is that the interface and interactivity of our website is just as important as the content we presented. Without the digital tools like Knight Lab timeline and Twine, our presentation would be much less engaging for users. In regards to the workshop we attended with Dr. Fahandej, it became clear that adding nuance and diverse perspectives into our content is key to creating a compelling narrative. In our work, we made sure to include the voices of stakeholders like Shanti Matthews, an expert like Erik Loomis, and social media users who are buzzing about the topic. We also learned that mixing media (written research, audio clips, and videos) can be taxing, but it ultimately makes the webpage more accessible to people with different preexisting knowledge levels. We hope to carry these lessons into our future journalistic endeavors.


WHAT DO WE HOPE OUR PROJECT WILL DO?


    We hope that our project will provide an immersive and informative experience on the 4-day work week. Our goal was to provide a thorough historical context on our topic in order to create a solid foundation for our audience. While the history of the 4-day work week is quite extensive, we made sure to highlight the most important points on the timeline.  We hope that the interactive timeline provides valuable insights into how the issue of the 4-day work week has progressed through present-day. With the story map, our aim was to present public opinion on the topic in order to demonstrate the real needs and benefits of a 4-day work week. This can be useful for both individuals and companies who are deciding to or in the midst of transitioning into a shorter work week. Furthermore, we included the expert perspective of University of Rhode Island professor and labor historian Erik Loomis by using Soundcloud to to display unique soundbites from our interview with him. We hope that this interview will ground this project in factual, credible information.
